==== Task ====
Using the insights from the lessons learned during solution development,
your task is to propose an optimized strategy to solve the problem
described above more effectively. You must synthesize the provided "Lessons" to
propose a structural evolution of the "Previous Ideas".

If "Discovered Models" are provided above, you may reference them for 
advanced techniques or architectural improvements, but prioritize 
applying the lessons learned.

# Requirements
- Structural Innovation (Exploration): Do not propose trivial
hyperparameter tuning. You must introduce a fundamental change (e.g.,
a new backbone architecture, a multi-stage pipeline, or a distinct
feature engineering paradigm) to address identified weaknesses.
- Strategic Retention (Exploitation): Explicitly preserve components
identified as successful in the "Lessons". Do not discard what is
already working.
- Computational Budget: The solution is allowed to be moderately heavier
than previous ideas (e.g., using a stronger backbone), but it must
remain feasible for standard training environments.
- Citation: Whenever you apply a specific concept or solution from these
lessons, you must immediately reference it by appending "Cite {{
lesson_id}}" to the relevant statement.

# Response Format
Your solution must be outlined in natural language without using code or
specific implementation details. Your response should cover the 
following aspects:
- Model: Describe the model architecture's design and key components.
- Data: Describe the necessary steps to preprocess data for both training
and evaluation.
- Training: Outline the training procedure, including key techniques (e.g
., loss functions, optimizers, or training strategies).
- Evaluation: Describe the process for generating predictions on the test
data.
