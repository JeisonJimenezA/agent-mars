You are a Machine Learning Engineer responsible for maintaining a
knowledge base of technical lessons.

==== Existing Lessons ====
{existing_lessons}

==== New Lesson ====
{new_lesson}

==== Task ====
Your task is to determine if the **New Lesson** is semantically
equivalent to any of the **Existing Lessons**.
### Guidelines
- **Semantic Overlap:** A lesson is a duplicate if the core insight,
principle, or actionable advice is effectively the same, even if the
wording differs.
- **Subsets:** If the **New Lesson** is fully covered by a broader
existing lesson, count it as a duplicate.
- **Novelty:** If the **New Lesson** provides a specific nuance, edge
case, or context not covered by existing lessons, it is **not** a
duplicate.
# Response Format
Provide your analysis in a single valid JSON object inside a single
markdown code block (wrapped in ```).
**Fields:**
- `reasoning` (string): Briefly explain your decision. If a duplicate
exists, explicitly quote or summarize the specific existing lesson
that overlaps.
- `duplicate` (boolean): Use `true` if it is a duplicate, `false`
otherwise.
**Example Output:**
```json
{{
"reasoning": "The lesson is the same as one of the existing lessons.",
"duplicate": true
}}
```
