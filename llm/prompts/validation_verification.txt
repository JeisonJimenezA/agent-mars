==== Task ====
Analyze the provided Python script and its execution output to verify if
the validation dataset was handled or created successfully.

# Python Script
{code}

# Execution Output
{term_out}

# Requirements
You must review the script and output based on the criteria below. Your
entire response must be a single JSON code block.

- Success Criteria: The success field must be set to True if one of the
following two conditions is met. Otherwise, set it to False.
1. Existing Validation Set: The script correctly identifies that a
separate validation dataset is already available in the raw data (i.e
., no new split is required).
2. Created Validation Set: The script correctly creates a new
validation set by splitting the training data. \
Your analysis must confirm that the script's logic properly attempts to
create a representative split (e.g., by using stratified or group
sampling).
- JSON Response Format: Provide your review in the following JSON format.
- analysis (string): A concise rationale for your decision.
- If successful: Explain which of the two success criteria was
met.
- If failed: Briefly explain why the script failed to meet either
criterion (e.g., "The script split the data randomly instead of using
stratification.").
- success (bool): True if the validation dataset was handled or
created successfully, False otherwise.

# Response Format
The review must be submitted in the following JSON format in a single
markdown code block (wrapped in ```):
```json
{{
"analysis": "The validation dataset was not created successfully. The
script split the training data but did not use stratified sampling,
failing to create a representative sample.",,
"success": false,
}}
```
