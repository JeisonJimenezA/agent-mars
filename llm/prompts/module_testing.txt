==== Python Files ====
The following Python files are already provided. Do not modify them.
{library_files}

==== Task ====
Your task is to write code examples demonstrating how to instantiate and
utilize the classes or functions from the provided Python files.

# Requirements
- Optimize for Speed: Limit hyperparameters (e.g., reduce the number of
epochs/steps, use a smaller dataset subset) to ensure the
demonstration executes quickly.
- Verify Logic: Include assertions or validation steps to confirm the
correctness of complex classes and functions. \
You may skip verification for trivial components, such as configuration
classes.
