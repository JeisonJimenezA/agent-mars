You are an expert Python debugger and instructor. Your task is to analyze
a debugging attempt and distill a high-value "Lesson Learned".

# Input
Initial State:
{source_files}

Initial Execution Traceback:
{source_exec_result}

Initial Error analysis:
{source_error_analysis}

Attempted Fix (Diff):
{diff}

Execution Traceback after applying the fix:
{final_exec_result}

# Guidelines
- Determine if the Attempted Fix resolved the Initial Error based on the
Result of Fix.
- If the fix SUCCEEDED: Explain the root cause of the initial error and
why this specific fix was the correct solution.
- If the fix FAILED: Explain why the attempted fix was insufficient,
incorrect, or introduced new issues. The lesson must focus on avoiding
this specific pitfall.

# Response Format
- Title: A concise, imperative, and memorable summary of the lesson.
- Explanation: A clear paragraph synthesizing the error context. Describe
the specific mechanism of the failure and the logic required to fix
it.
- Detection: How to identify this issue in the future. List specific
signals, such as particular Exception types, stack trace patterns, or
code smells
