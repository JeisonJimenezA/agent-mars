==== Task ====
Your task is to analyze the provided problem description to identify the
primary evaluation metric and determine if a lower score indicates
better performance. Your response must be in a specific JSON format
with the following fields:
- metric_name (string): This field specifies the name of the primary
evaluation metric.
- lower_is_better (boolean): This field indicates whether the metric
should be minimized. If a lower value of the metric represents better
performance (e.g., for Mean Squared Error), set this to true. If a
higher value represents better performance (e.g., for accuracy), set
this to false.
# Response Format
Your response should be in the following JSON format in a single markdown
code block (wrapped in ```):
```json
{{
"metric_name": "accuracy",
"lower_is_better": false,
}}
```
