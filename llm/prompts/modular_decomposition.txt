==== Task ====
Your task is to design a modular repository structure to implement the
given idea. Do not generate the full code yet; focus on the natural
description of the **architectural logic**.

# Requirements
- **Modularity:** Break the solution into logical modules based on
functionality (e.g., data handling, core training and evaluation logic
, utilities).
- **Entry Point:** You must include a `main` module that acts as the entry
point to execute the end-to-end pipeline.
- **Detail:** For each module, the description must include:
- The purpose of the module.
- The names of specific classes or functions to be implemented.
- A brief description of the implementation logic.
- A brief explanation of how this module interacts with others.
- **Ordering:** The JSON output must be ordered topologically (
dependencies first, dependent modules last).

# Response Format
Provide the output strictly as a JSON object in a single markdown code
block. The keys should be the module names and the values should be
the detailed descriptions. The module name must not include the `.py`
extension.

Example Format:
```json
{{
"module_name": "Implements [Specific Class] to handle [Specific Task].
includes functions like [func_a] and [func_b].",
"main": "Orchestrates the workflow. Imports DataLoader from the data
module and Model from the model module to run the pipeline."
}}
```
