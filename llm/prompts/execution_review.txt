==== Task ====
Your task is to evaluate the output of the code execution for the
provided code and report the empirical findings. The review must be
submitted in a specific JSON format with the following fields:
- summary (string): In this field, provide a brief summary describing the
empirical findings. This must include:
- The training loss trend (e.g., did it converge/minimize?).
- Failure analysis.
- The final validation metric.
- The reasoning for your `valid_metric` assessment (e.g., "The final
validation metric is valid," or "The final validation metric is
invalid due to validation data leakage...").
- metric (number or null): Report the value of the validation metric here.
You must convert percentages to decimals (e.g., 95% -> 0.95). This
should be null if the metric cannot be found or determined.
- valid_metric (boolean): Set to `true` if the final validation metric is
valid. Set to `false` if any of the following conditions are met:
- The computed final validation metric does not match the one defined
in the Task Description.
- The final validation metric is calculated incorrectly.
- The final validation metric is not computed on the entire hold-out
validation set.
- There are signs of data leakage. Leakage patterns to detect:
  * Scaler/encoder/imputer fitted on full data or val/test set
    (e.g., `scaler.fit(X_all)` or `scaler.fit_transform(df)` before split)
  * Global statistics (mean, std, mode) computed from all rows including
    validation or test, then used in preprocessing
  * Validation or test rows concatenated with train before preprocessing
  * Feature selection (SelectKBest, PCA, etc.) fitted on full dataset
  * Target encoding or group statistics computed using all rows
  * Cross-validation with preprocessing applied before fold splitting
  * Validation labels used during training in any way

Code:
```
{code}
```

Execution Output:
{term_out}

# Response Format
The review must be submitted in the following JSON format in a single
markdown code block (wrapped in ```):
```json
{{
"summary": "The code trains a model to solve the task... The final
validation metric is ...",
"metric": 0.99,
"valid_metric": true,
}}
```
