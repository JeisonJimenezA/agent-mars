==== Task ====
Your task is to propose a highly efficient **baseline approach** to solve
the problem described above.

# Requirements

- Novelty: The proposed solution must remain strictly distinct from the
approaches listed in Previous Ideas.
- Model Design: Synthesize a simple and lightweight architecture using
the provided Model Architectures as a conceptual foundation. Ensure
the design is unique and has not been suggested in the Previous Ideas.
- Philosophy: Prioritize speed and simplicity over maximum accuracy.
Exclude resource-intensive techniques, such as heavy augmentations or
ensembles, to establish a reliable performance baseline.

# Response Format
Your solution must be outlined in natural language without using code or
specific implementation details. Your response should cover the
following aspects:
- Model: Describe the model architecture's design and key components.
- Data: Describe the necessary steps to preprocess data for both training
and evaluation. IMPORTANT: all preprocessing (scaling, encoding,
imputation) must be fit exclusively on the training set and then
applied separately to validation and test — never fit on the full
dataset or test set (data leakage).
- Training: Outline the training procedure, including key techniques (e.g
., loss functions, optimizers, or training strategies).
- Evaluation: Describe the process for generating predictions on the test
data.
