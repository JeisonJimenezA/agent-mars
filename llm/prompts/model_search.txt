{problem_description}

==== Task ====
Your task is to propose {num_model_candidates} distinct model
architectures to solve the problem described above. Research and propose
the most appropriate approaches for THIS SPECIFIC problem.

# Requirements
- **Problem-Driven Selection:** Analyze the problem characteristics first
(data type, size, target variable, evaluation metric) and then propose
models that are well-suited for those characteristics.
- **Broad Diversity:** The candidates should represent different
algorithmic families or approaches. Avoid proposing multiple variations
of the same method.
- **Problem Alignment:** Architectures must be specifically tailored to
the data modality and problem structure. Consider what has worked well
for similar problems.
- **Efficiency First:** Prioritize designs that offer good trade-offs
between computational cost and performance.
- **Data Constraints:** If the training data is limited, address
regularization or simpler designs to prevent overfitting.
- For each model, create a JSON object with the following keys:
- `reasoning`: Justification for why this architecture fits THIS
specific problem (consider data characteristics, metric, constraints).
- `description`: A technical description of the architecture and
design philosophy.

# Response Format
Your response should be in the following JSON format in a single markdown
code block (wrapped in ```):
```json
[
{{"reasoning": "This approach is suitable because...", "description": "
The model works by..."}},
{{"reasoning": "This alternative offers...", "description": "
This architecture uses..."}},
]
```
