==== Task ====
Your task is to propose {num_model_candidates} distinct model
architectures to solve the problem. **Action:** Use Google Search to
research state-of-the-art and efficient architectures relevant to this
domain.

# Requirements
- **Broad Diversity:** The candidates must represent different
algorithmic families. Do not propose multiple variations of the same
underlying method (e.g., do not suggest two different ResNets). Aim
for a mix of:
* Instance-Based / Kernel Methods (e.g., k-NN, SVM)
* Tree-Based Ensembles (e.g., LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost)
* Deep Learning (e.g., CNN, MLP, Transformers, RNNs)
- **Problem Alignment:** Architectures must be specifically tailored to
the data modality (e.g., tabular, image, time-series) and input
structure.
- **Hybridization:** Incorporate hybrid or ensemble designs if they offer
a clear advantage for heterogeneous data.
- **Efficiency First:** Prioritize "lightweight" designs. For each family,
choose the architecture that offers the best trade-off between low
computational cost (fast training/inference) and high performance.
- **Data Constraints:** If the training data is limited, explicitly
address regularization or low-complexity designs to prevent
overfitting.
- For each model, create a JSON object with the following two keys:
- `reasoning`: Justification for why this architecture fits the
constraints (efficiency, data size, and why it was chosen over others
in its category).
- `description`: A technical description of the architecture and
design philosophy.

# Response Format
Your response should be in the following JSON format in a single markdown
code block (wrapped in ```):
```json
[
{{"reasoning": "k-NN is small and efficient...", "description": "We
can use K-NN for this task..."}},
{{"reasoning": "CNN is effective and efficient...", "description": "
We can use CNN for this task..."}},
{{"reasoning": "GBMs is an effective model...", "description": "We
can use GBMs for this task..."}},
]
```
