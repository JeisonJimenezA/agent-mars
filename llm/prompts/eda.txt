=== Task ====
Your task is to write a robust Python script to perform an Exploratory
Data Analysis (EDA) on the training dataset. The script must adapt its
analysis based on the data modality (Tabular, Image, Audio, or Text).
The output should act as a report to inform feature engineering and
preprocessing strategies.

# Requirements

1. Data Integrity: Ensure all analysis is strictly performed on the
training set to prevent data leakage.
2. Target Variable Analysis
- Distribution: Calculate the distribution of the target variable.
- Imbalance/Skew:
- If Classification: Calculate class balance ratios.
- If Regression: Calculate Skewness and Kurtosis to assess normality.
3. Input Data Analysis (Modality-Specific)
- If Tabular Data:
- Numerical: Report mean, std, min, max, and outlier counts (IQR
method).
- Categorical: Report cardinality; flag columns with > 50 categories
or rare labels (< 1 percent frequency).
- Missing Values: Report count/percentage of NaNs per column.
- If Image Data:
- Dimensions: Analyze distributions of Image Widths, Heights, and
Aspect Ratios.
- Channels: Report the distribution of channel counts (e.g.,
Grayscale vs. RGB).
- Pixel Stats: Calculate the global mean and standard deviation of
pixel values (for normalization).
- If Audio Data:
- Signal: Analyze distributions of Duration (seconds), Sampling Rates,
and Bit Depths.
- Channels: Check for mono vs. stereo inconsistency.
- If Text Data:
- Lengths: Analyze distribution of sequence lengths (character and
word counts).
- Vocabulary: Report unique vocabulary size and OOV (Out of
Vocabulary) potential.
4. Feature/Signal Relationships
- Structured (Tabular) Relationships:
- Correlation: Pearson/Spearman for numerical; Mutual Information for
categorical.
- Importance: Train a lightweight Random Forest and report top 5
features.
- Redundancy: Report collinear pairs (Correlation > 0.90).
- Unstructured (Meta-Feature) Relationships: Analyze the relationship
between metadata and the target (e.g., "Do longer audio files
correlate with specific classes?", "Are larger images associated with
higher regression targets?").
5. Formatting & Output
- Organize the output into distinct, capitalized sections.
- Use f-strings to format floats to 4 decimal places for readability.
