==== Task ====
You are tasked with debugging a script failure. You should summarize the
execution traceback and explain the root cause of the errors. You
should apply the relevant knowledge provided in the Debug Lessons
section to support your diagnosis. Whenever you apply a specific
concept or solution from these lessons, you must immediately reference
it by appending "Cite {{lesson_id}}" to the relevant statement. You
can use Google Search as needed for debugging.

Execution Traceback (`python runfile.py`):
{exec_result}

# Analysis Requirements
Your analysis should include:

1. **Error Type:** [ImportError|FileNotFoundError|AttributeError|etc.]

2. **Root Cause:** 
   Explain WHAT went wrong and WHY (not just symptoms)

3. **Precise Location:**
   - File: [filename.py]
   - Approximate line/section
   - Relevant code context (show the problematic line)

4. **Impact Assessment:**
   Is this a critical error or a minor issue?

5. **Recommended Fix Strategy:**
   Describe the MINIMAL change needed (1-2 sentences)

6. **Relevant Lessons:**
   Cite any applicable debug lessons

# Critical Points
- Focus on ROOT CAUSE, not just the error message
- Be specific about which file and line
- Identify the MINIMAL fix needed
- Don't propose solutions yet, just diagnose
