Otto Group Product Classification Challenge

OBJECTIVE:
Classify products into correct categories based on provided features.

DATASET:
Files:
- train.csv: Training data with labels
- test.csv: Test data for predictions
- sampleSubmission.csv: Example submission format

Training Data Structure:
- Samples: 61,878 rows
- Columns: id, feat_1, feat_2, ..., feat_93, target
- Features: 93 anonymous numerical features (feat_1 through feat_93)
  * All features contain count data (non-negative integers)
  * Feature meanings are not provided (anonymous)
  * No metadata about what features represent
- Target: Product category (Class_1, Class_2, ..., Class_9)
  * 9 distinct classes
  * Distribution varies across classes

Test Data Structure:
- Samples: 144,368 rows
- Columns: id, feat_1, feat_2, ..., feat_93
- No target column (must predict)

EVALUATION:
Metric: Multi-class logarithmic loss (logloss)
Direction: Lower is better (minimize)

Formula: -1/N * Σ(i=1 to N) Σ(j=1 to M) y_ij * log(p_ij)
Where:
- N = number of observations
- M = number of classes (9)
- y_ij = 1 if observation i belongs to class j, 0 otherwise
- p_ij = predicted probability that observation i belongs to class j

Notes:
- All predicted probabilities must sum to 1.0 for each observation
- Confident wrong predictions are heavily penalized
- Well-calibrated probabilities are essential

SUBMISSION FORMAT:
File: submission.csv
Columns: id, Class_1, Class_2, Class_3, Class_4, Class_5, Class_6, Class_7, Class_8, Class_9
- Each row must contain probabilities for all 9 classes
- Probabilities must sum to 1.0
- Example line: 1,0.1,0.05,0.05,0.2,0.15,0.1,0.15,0.1,0.1

VALIDATION:
Use stratified cross-validation to ensure class balance in splits.
Print validation metric as: "Final Validation Metric: <value>"

LEADERBOARD:
- Top scores: ~0.38 (1st place)
- Strong scores: ~0.42 (top 10%)
- Good scores: ~0.50 (top 25%)
- Baseline: ~0.55

CONSTRAINTS:
- Maximum execution time per run: 10 minutes
- Must handle all 61,878 training samples
- Must generate predictions for all 144,368 test samples
